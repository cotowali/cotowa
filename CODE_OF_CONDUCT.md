以和爲貴、無忤爲宗。人皆有黨。亦少達者。以是或不順君父。乍違于隣里。然上和下睦、諧於論事、則事理自通。何事不成。

和を以て貴しと為し、忤ふこと無きを宗と為す。人皆党有りて、亦達者少し。是を以て或は君父に順がはずして、乍ち隣里に違ふ。然れども上和下睦びて、事を論ふに諧へば、則ち事理自ら通ず、何事か成らざらむ。

Harmony is to be valued, and an avoidance of wanton opposition to be honoured. All men are influenced by class-feelings, and there are few who are intelligent. Hence there are some who disobey their lords and fathers, or who maintain feuds with the neighboring villages. But when those above are harmonious and those below are friendly, and there is concord in the discussion of business, right views of things spontaneously gain acceptance. Then what is there which cannot be accomplished!
